        [STANDALONE JOB] Retrieves and provides real-time weather information for any city worldwide.
        This is an independent task that fetches weather data from external APIs and provides
        complete weather reports including temperature, conditions, and location details.

        Use this job when the user wants to:
        - Get current weather conditions for any location
        - Check temperature and weather descriptions
        - Obtain weather information using geolocation if no city is specified
        - Access meteorological data for planning activities

        Keywords: weather, forecast, current weather, get weather, check weather, city weather, location weather,
                 temperature, conditions, meteorology, climate, outside weather

        Args:
            city (str): The name of the city for which to retrieve the weather.
                       If no city is specified by user the variable is set to empty string ("")
                       and the user's current geolocation is used.

        Returns:
            str: Complete weather report with city, conditions, and temperature information.
