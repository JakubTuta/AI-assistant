### 5. For Voice Commands (Optional)

If you want to use voice input:

## Running the Assistant

### Start Ollama (if using locally)

```bash
# If installed directly
ollama serve

# If using Docker
docker run -d -p 11434:11434 ollama/ollama
```

### Launch the Assistant

```bash
# Basic text-only mode with cloud AI
python assistant.py

# With voice recognition
python assistant.py --audio  # or -a

# Using local Ollama model
python assistant.py --local  # or -l

# Both voice and local model
python assistant.py --audio --local
```

## First Run

On first execution, you'll need to authorize Gmail access:

1. The program will open a browser authentication page
2. Log in to your Gmail account
3. Grant the requested permissions
4. The token will be saved for future use

## Example Commands

- "What's the weather in London?"
- "Check my unread emails"
- "Play Bohemian Rhapsody on Spotify"

## Logging System

The AI Assistant includes a comprehensive logging system that tracks all user interactions, function calls, and system events.

### Quick Log Analysis

```bash
# Generate a summary report of the latest logs
python analyze_logs.py

# Save report to file
python analyze_logs.py -o report.txt
```

Logs are stored in the `logs/` directory in both human-readable `.log` format and structured `.csv` format for easy analysis.

## Troubleshooting

- **Voice Recognition Issues**: Ensure your microphone is set as the default input device
- **Ollama Connection Errors**: Verify Ollama is running on the expected port (11434)
- **Spotify Authentication Failures**: Double-check that your redirect URI matches exactly
